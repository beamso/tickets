# Zendesk coding challenge

## installing testing dependencies
* `gem install bundler`, if [bundler](https://bundler.io) is not installed.
* `bundle install`

## suggested usage, as per the documentation
* `ruby ./search_tool.rb -keys users`
* `ruby ./search_tool.rb -search users _id 71`

## what is potentially lazy
* files are hard coded and being read from the root directory of the project
